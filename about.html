She is an Assistant Professor of Game Design and Unit Coordinator at the City University of New York’s Eugenio Mar&iacute;a de Hostos Community College. At Hostos, she has been developing the first public game design degree program in New York City since 2015. Prior to that, Morrow earned an MFA in Design and Technology from Parsons School of Design.

<p>Her unusual games, often infused with dark humor, feature distinctive aesthetics and novel premises. Examples include Oral Perspectives, a VR game taking place inside the player’s mouth, and Mastering Tedium, an existentialist laundry simulator played inside a text terminal. Recent work includes Pruuds vs. Sloots, a “dumb versus game,” Blood Broker, a human sacrifice management simulator, and Marginalia, a memoir examining intersections of mixed-race and transgender identities.</p>
